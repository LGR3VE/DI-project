# Digital Innovation - Coding Project
Dear Students,

this is the repository for our DI coding project. You will find all information and assignments here. The code we produce during the tutorial sessions will be pushed to this repo, so you can build upon it for your homework assignments. Example solutions for the assignments will also be added to this repo.

## Schedule
### Wednesdays - Live Coding Sessions 
Our live coding sessions will be held from 12:15pm to 1:45pm. Zoom Meeting URL can be found in LSF

### Fridays - Consultation
I will be available for questions and problems every Friday from 3pm to 5pm. This is a voluntary offer to everyone. You can just join the Zoom Meeting and get help, if you are stuck somewhere. We will reuse the lecture Zoom meeting for the consultation, URL can be found in LSF.\
Exception: The third consultation will be held on Thursday, 23.12.2021, instead of Friday.
